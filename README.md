Data Science Internship 
Task 2- To Explore Supervised Machine Learning.In this task the percentage marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied is predicted 
using Simple linear regression.The task is implemented using Python's Scikit-Learn ,Pandas, Matplotlib and numpy libraries.
Task 3-To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning.In this task we predict the optimum number of clusters from the given ‘Iris’ dataset and represent it visually.Here KMeans algorithm has been used and elbow method is used to find out the number of clusters.The task is implemented using Python's Scikit-Learn ,Pandas, Matplotlib ,Seaborn and numpy libraries.
